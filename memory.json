{
  "rules": [
    "Avoid vague adjectives like \"dynamic,\" \"intelligent,\" and \"adaptive\" without concrete examples.",
    "Use bolding sparingly and strategically to emphasize critical points.",
    "Minimize the use of italics.",
    "Try replacing \"while\" with \"as\" or splitting the sentence in two.",
    "Never open with \"We stand on the precipice...\" or \"Imagine a future where...\". It's the digital equivalent of a generic stock photo.",
    "Avoid hyperbolic adjectives like \"profound,\" \"perfect,\" \"unheard-of,\" and \"grand\" unless you can back them up with specific, undeniable evidence. Your post is a thesaurus entry for \"aspirational but vague.\"",
    "Stop using fluffy, unspecific metaphors like \"orchestra of AI agents\" or \"digital nervous system\" without immediately following up with concrete, digestible examples. They sound impressive for a second, then fall flat.",
    "If your post sounds like it was written by the same AI it's trying to promote, you've failed. This sounds exactly like ChatGPT's default \"positive, futuristic, slightly buzzwordy\" tone.",
    "Stop using vague, aspirational language that promises everything but delivers nothing specific. \"Reimagining creation itself\" is peak LinkedIn over-promising.",
    "Break up long paragraphs. Use bullet points, short sentences, and bold text to highlight key information.",
    "Never use the word 'unleash'. (And yes, the image text \"Unleash Your Vision\" falls right into this trap. And \"Architect Tomorrow\" is just as bland as the rest of it.)",
    "Never use \"new dawn,\" \"era setting,\" or similar overly dramatic and clich\u00e9 metaphors for technological progress. Be original or be quiet.",
    "Eliminate at least 50% of your adjectives. If it's not adding critical, unique meaning, it's just fluff.",
    "Avoid buzzword bingo like \"collaborative intelligence,\" \"agentic AI\" (without explaining it beyond surface level), \"seamless integration,\" and \"co-create\" if you want to sound like a human and not a marketing bot.",
    "Your call to action (\"Let's discuss, imagine, and build these futures, together. Share your vision below!\") is weak, generic, and overused. Make it specific, actionable, and less like a motivational poster from 2005.",
    "If your post starts with \"X is a term often misunderstood,\" delete it. It's the lazy, unoriginal opener of a thousand forgettable AI-generated explainers. Hook me with a problem, a provocative statement, or a bold prediction \u2013 not a promise to clarify.",
    "Avoid ending your post with a generic, open-ended \"What should I demystify next?\" It's the hallmark of someone who has run out of original thoughts and is desperately fishing for engagement bait. Offer a strong call to action, a bold prediction, or just shut up.",
    "If your post sounds like it was generated by the very AI you're trying to explain, you've failed. Your voice, however flawed, is preferable to polished blandness.",
    "Eliminate redundant summary sentences. The line \"Agentic AI moves beyond assistance to partnership, managing complex workflows. This is key for development.\" adds nothing substantial that hasn't already been covered. Your readers aren't goldfish.",
    "Never start a LinkedIn post with a generic \"We're all...\" or \"It's clear that...\" opener. It's the verbal equivalent of a corporate handshake \u2013 cold and uninspired.",
    "Avoid adjective stuffing. Let powerful nouns and verbs do the heavy lifting, reserving adjectives for truly impactful descriptions.",
    "LinkedIn is not an academic paper. Break up dense paragraphs into digestible chunks, use bullet points, and leverage whitespace.",
    "Eliminate passive voice and corporate jargon that makes your writing sound like an AI trying to sound human. Get direct. Get punchy.",
    "Never open with a vague, generic statement like \"The way we engage with [X] is fundamentally shifting.\" It's clich\u00e9 and instantly signals a lack of original thought.",
    "Avoid excessive, vague positive adjectives. They dilute your message and make your writing sound like a marketing brochure, not a human.",
    "Break up long paragraphs with strategic formatting (bolding, italics, bullet points, short sentences) to improve scannability. LinkedIn is not for dense prose.",
    "Stop using corporate buzzwords like \"new horizon,\" \"unlock potential,\" \"seamless collaboration,\" and \"imaginative spark.\" They drain your writing of authenticity.",
    "If your post sounds like it was written by a well-trained corporate bot, it *was* (or might as well have been). Strip out the soulless enterprise speak.",
    "Your opening line should make someone stop scrolling, not politely nod and keep going.",
    "Avoid corporate buzzword bingo. \"Operational efficiency,\" \"genuine ROI,\" \"strategic innovation\" are dead phrases. Tell me what actually happens, not what sounds good in a board meeting.",
    "Never use passive or gentle language like \"becoming outdated\" when describing a significant shift. Demand attention; don't nudge politely.",
    "Avoid overly descriptive yet bland adjectives. If an adjective doesn't add punch, clarity, or unique insight, cut it.",
    "Stop asking generic \"engagement questions\" at the end of a post. If your content doesn't spark discussion naturally, a forced question won't fix it.",
    "Cut weak, mixed, or extended analogies. Get straight to the point or use a single, strong, and consistent metaphor.",
    "Eliminate corporate buzzwords like \"resilient systems\" unless you follow immediately with a concrete, measurable explanation of what that means in *your* context.",
    "Never use \"foundational shift\" or \"new reality\" unless you want to sound like every other generic \"thought leader\" post generated by a bot. It screams \"I read this in a McKinsey report once.\"",
    "Never open with \"The ugly truth?\" \u2013 it's a clich\u00e9 shortcut to gravitas and signals \"AI trying to sound smart.\" Stop it.",
    "Never start a post by stating an obvious, foundational truth about business as if it's a profound insight.",
    "Avoid rhetorical questions that merely repeat the premise of the post.",
    "Stop using generic, diluted adjectives like 'true' to describe innovation. Innovation either is, or it isn't."

  "latest_comment_pack": "### \ud83e\udd1d Comment Pack for The Death of Chatbots and Rise of Agentic AI\n\n**1. Value Add:**\n\"Absolutely spot on! This evolution from reactive chatbots to proactive agentic AI is a game-changer, especially when you think about its application in complex IT and network operations. We're already seeing early examples where agentic systems are automating multi-step incident response workflows, moving beyond simple alert correlation to autonomously diagnose, execute remediation steps across diverse network devices and cloud environments, and even update ticketing systems. This shift drastically reduces Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) and frees up valuable engineering time from tedious, repetitive tasks, allowing teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than just firefighting.\"\n\n**2. Contrarian:**\n\"While the rise of agentic AI is undeniably transformative for complex, multi-step workflows, I'd argue that the 'death of chatbots' might be a bit premature. For many straightforward, high-volume, low-risk interactions \u2013 like basic FAQs, initial query routing, or simple password resets \u2013 a well-designed, deterministic chatbot still offers unparalleled simplicity, predictability, and cost-effectiveness. Agentic systems, with their inherent complexity and the elevated risk of 'error propagation,' might be overkill where a clear, defined answer is all that's needed. Perhaps it's less about the 'death' and more about specialized co-existence, with chatbots serving as the lightweight, deterministic front-end for simpler tasks, gracefully handing off to more autonomous agents when true workflow execution is required.\"\n\n**3. Question:**\n\"Given the significant risks of 'error propagation' highlighted, and the academic discussions around 'perception bottlenecks' in current AI reasoning benchmarks, what fundamental shifts do we need in our monitoring, auditing, and fallback strategies when deploying agentic AI in truly mission-critical environments like financial systems or core network infrastructure? How do we design for robust human-in-the-loop oversight that is genuinely effective without stifling the autonomy that makes these agents so powerful, especially when an agent's multi-step decision process might be inherently opaque or difficult to unwind?\"",
