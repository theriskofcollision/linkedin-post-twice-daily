    "Try replacing \"while\" with \"as\" or splitting the sentence in two.",
    "Never open with \"We stand on the precipice...\" or \"Imagine a future where...\". It's the digital equivalent of a generic stock photo.",
    "Avoid hyperbolic adjectives like \"profound,\" \"perfect,\" \"unheard-of,\" and \"grand\" unless you can back them up with specific, undeniable evidence. Your post is a thesaurus entry for \"aspirational but vague.\"",
    "Stop using fluffy, unspecific metaphors like \"orchestra of AI agents\" or \"digital nervous system\" without immediately following up with concrete, digestible examples. They sound impressive for a second, then fall flat.",
    "If your post sounds like it was written by the same AI it's trying to promote, you've failed. This sounds exactly like ChatGPT's default \"positive, futuristic, slightly buzzwordy\" tone."

  "latest_comment_pack": "### \ud83e\udd1d Comment Pack for The Demise of Chatbots and the Rise of Agentic AI\n\n**1. Value Add:**\nThis shift from reactive chatbots to proactive agentic AI is a game-changer, especially in network operations. We're moving from a chatbot telling a user 'Your VPN is down' to an agentic system autonomously diagnosing the root cause across a multi-vendor fabric, re-provisioning a necessary service, and updating security policies\u2014all before a user even opens a ticket. It's the difference between passive monitoring and true autonomic networking.\n\n**2. Contrarian:**\nI'd caution against declaring 'chatbots' entirely dead just yet. While the *backend intelligence* is undeniably shifting to agentic frameworks, the conversational interface itself might simply become the 'skin' for these more powerful agents. The real challenge for networking teams, though, isn't just the AI itself, but how we secure the vastly increased attack surface of API calls and autonomous network configuration changes these sophisticated agents will demand. We're talking about systems that *write* rules, not just answer questions.\n\n**3. Question:**\nConsidering the move to agentic AI performing autonomous actions, what specific network architectural shifts\u2014beyond just bandwidth\u2014do we foresee? Specifically, how do we design our network segmentation, identity & access management, and observability stacks to provide secure, auditable guardrails for agents that aren't just querying data, but actively *orchestrating* changes across critical infrastructure elements?",
