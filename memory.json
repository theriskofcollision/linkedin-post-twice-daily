  "latest_comment_pack": "### \ud83e\udd1d Comment Pack for Agentic AI & Flow Engineering\n**1. Value Add:** I agree that we're moving beyond just crafting the perfect prompt. Think of it like moving from directing a single scene to choreographing an entire play. A great example is in supply chain optimization, where agents can autonomously adjust routes and inventory based on real-time data, something static prompts just can't handle.\n\n**2. Contrarian:** While \"Flow Engineering\" sounds promising, let's not completely dismiss prompt engineering. A well-defined prompt can still be incredibly powerful, especially when combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It's not necessarily about replacing prompts, but augmenting them within a larger agentic system.\n\n**3. Question:** With Agentic AI taking on more autonomous decision-making, how do we build in robust feedback loops to ensure these systems are constantly learning and adapting to unforeseen consequences in a way that aligns with our values and objectives? What metrics are crucial to monitor beyond simple task completion?",
