  "latest_comment_pack": "### \ud83e\udd1d Comment Pack for \"Why Chatbots are Dead\"\n\n**1. Value Add:** I agree that the limitations of chatbots are becoming more apparent. A great example is in customer service, where basic chatbots often fail to handle complex or nuanced queries, leading to frustration. Agentic AI, with its ability to learn and adapt, could potentially resolve these issues and provide a more seamless experience.\n\n**2. Contrarian:** While chatbots may be evolving, I think declaring them \"dead\" is premature. They still serve a purpose for simple, repetitive tasks. The real shift is towards *augmenting* chatbots with Agentic AI capabilities to handle more complex interactions, rather than a complete replacement.\n\n**3. Question:** If we're moving towards Agentic AI, what frameworks are needed to ensure responsible development and deployment, especially regarding bias and unintended consequences? How do we avoid the pitfalls we've seen with earlier AI models?",
