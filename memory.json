  "rules": [
    "Avoid vague adjectives like \"dynamic,\" \"intelligent,\" and \"adaptive\" without concrete examples.",
    "Use bolding sparingly and strategically to emphasize critical points.",
    "Minimize the use of italics.",
    "Try replacing \"while\" with \"as\" or splitting the sentence in two.",
    "Never open with \"We stand on the precipice...\" or \"Imagine a future where...\". It's the digital equivalent of a generic stock photo.",
    "Avoid hyperbolic adjectives like \"profound,\" \"perfect,\" \"unheard-of,\" and \"grand\" unless you can back them up with specific, undeniable evidence. Your post is a thesaurus entry for \"aspirational but vague.\"",
    "Stop using fluffy, unspecific metaphors like \"orchestra of AI agents\" or \"digital nervous system\" without immediately following up with concrete, digestible examples. They sound impressive for a second, then fall flat.",
    "If your post sounds like it was written by the same AI it's trying to promote, you've failed. This sounds exactly like ChatGPT's default \"positive, futuristic, slightly buzzwordy\" tone.",
    "Stop using vague, aspirational language that promises everything but delivers nothing specific. \"Reimagining creation itself\" is peak LinkedIn over-promising.",
    "Break up long paragraphs. Use bullet points, short sentences, and bold text to highlight key information.",
    "Never use the word 'unleash'. (And yes, the image text \"Unleash Your Vision\" falls right into this trap. And \"Architect Tomorrow\" is just as bland as the rest of it.)",
    "Never use \"new dawn,\" \"era setting,\" or similar overly dramatic and clich\u00e9 metaphors for technological progress. Be original or be quiet.",
    "Eliminate at least 50% of your adjectives. If it's not adding critical, unique meaning, it's just fluff.",
    "Avoid buzzword bingo like \"collaborative intelligence,\" \"agentic AI\" (without explaining it beyond surface level), \"seamless integration,\" and \"co-create\" if you want to sound like a human and not a marketing bot.",
    "Your call to action (\"Let's discuss, imagine, and build these futures, together. Share your vision below!\") is weak, generic, and overused. Make it specific, actionable, and less like a motivational poster from 2005.",
    "If your post starts with \"X is a term often misunderstood,\" delete it. It's the lazy, unoriginal opener of a thousand forgettable AI-generated explainers. Hook me with a problem, a provocative statement, or a bold prediction \u2013 not a promise to clarify.",
    "Avoid ending your post with a generic, open-ended \"What should I demystify next?\" It's the hallmark of someone who has run out of original thoughts and is desperately fishing for engagement bait. Offer a strong call to action, a bold prediction, or just shut up.",
    "If your post sounds like it was generated by the very AI you're trying to explain, you've failed. Your voice, however flawed, is preferable to polished blandness.",
    "Eliminate redundant summary sentences. The line \"Agentic AI moves beyond assistance to partnership, managing complex workflows. This is key for development.\" adds nothing substantial that hasn't already been covered. Your readers aren't goldfish.",
    "Never start a LinkedIn post with a generic \"We're all...\" or \"It's clear that...\" opener. It's the verbal equivalent of a corporate handshake \u2013 cold and uninspired.",
    "Avoid adjective stuffing. Let powerful nouns and verbs do the heavy lifting, reserving adjectives for truly impactful descriptions.",
    "LinkedIn is not an academic paper. Break up dense paragraphs into digestible chunks, use bullet points, and leverage whitespace.",
    "Eliminate passive voice and corporate jargon that makes your writing sound like an AI trying to sound human. Get direct. Get punchy.",
    "Never open with a vague, generic statement like \"The way we engage with [X] is fundamentally shifting.\" It's clich\u00e9 and instantly signals a lack of original thought.",
    "Avoid excessive, vague positive adjectives. They dilute your message and make your writing sound like a marketing brochure, not a human.",
    "Break up long paragraphs with strategic formatting (bolding, italics, bullet points, short sentences) to improve scannability. LinkedIn is not for dense prose.",
    "Stop using corporate buzzwords like \"new horizon,\" \"unlock potential,\" \"seamless collaboration,\" and \"imaginative spark.\" They drain your writing of authenticity.",
    "If your post sounds like it was written by a well-trained corporate bot, it *was* (or might as well have been). Strip out the soulless enterprise speak.",
    "Your opening line should make someone stop scrolling, not politely nod and keep going.",
    "Avoid corporate buzzword bingo. \"Operational efficiency,\" \"genuine ROI,\" \"strategic innovation\" are dead phrases. Tell me what actually happens, not what sounds good in a board meeting.",
    "Never use passive or gentle language like \"becoming outdated\" when describing a significant shift. Demand attention; don't nudge politely.",
    "Avoid overly descriptive yet bland adjectives. If an adjective doesn't add punch, clarity, or unique insight, cut it.",
    "Stop asking generic \"engagement questions\" at the end of a post. If your content doesn't spark discussion naturally, a forced question won't fix it.",
    "Cut weak, mixed, or extended analogies. Get straight to the point or use a single, strong, and consistent metaphor.",
    "Eliminate corporate buzzwords like \"resilient systems\" unless you follow immediately with a concrete, measurable explanation of what that means in *your* context.",
    "Never use \"foundational shift\" or \"new reality\" unless you want to sound like every other generic \"thought leader\" post generated by a bot. It screams \"I read this in a McKinsey report once.\"",
    "Never open with \"The ugly truth?\" \u2013 it's a clich\u00e9 shortcut to gravitas and signals \"AI trying to sound smart.\" Stop it.",
    "Never start a post by stating an obvious, foundational truth about business as if it's a profound insight.",
    "Avoid rhetorical questions that merely repeat the premise of the post.",
    "Stop using generic, diluted adjectives like 'true' to describe innovation. Innovation either is, or it isn't.",
    "Never use \"This isn't theory\" or \"Ignore the hype.\" These are crutches for posts that lack actual substance.",
    "Avoid opening with \"isn't *what* but *how*.\" It's a clich\u00e9 that signals generic content.",
    "Stop using \"double-digit gains\" unless you follow it immediately with specific, verifiable data. Otherwise, it's just fluff.",
    "Your call to action questions are as generic as the rest of the post. Ask something *specific* or don't ask at all.",
    "Stop using tired corporate buzzwords and phrases like \"operational ROI,\" \"revenue-driving projects,\" or \"measurable impact.\" If it sounds like it came from a marketing brochure you deleted five years ago, don't use it. Speak like a human, not a malfunctioning thesaurus.",
    "Never use the phrase \"The ugly truth.\" It's as original as a stock photo of diverse people laughing at a laptop.",
    "Never use phrases like \"direct hit to your budget and market position\" or \"frees high-value engineers for innovation, not firefighting.\" They are generic, uninspired, and signal that you've outsourced your thinking to an algorithm. Find a human way to say it.",
    "Repetitive use of corporate buzzwords like \"measurable ROI\" or \"data-backed view\" kills any impact. Vary your language or, better yet, imply the benefit with a concrete example instead of just stating the buzzword.",
    "Avoid templated objection-handling like \"X is a valid concern. Yet, data shows clear returns.\" It's condescending and predictable. Address concerns with specific, compelling evidence or a more nuanced perspective, not a canned response.",
    "Avoid corporate buzzword bingo and generic 'thought leader' phrasing that could come from a template. Your post is riddled with phrases like \"real pivot,\" \"doesn't just respond; it performs,\" \"strategic leaders measure value, not just spend,\" \"shifts resources,\" \"high-value work,\" and \"bottleneck to accelerator.\" These are hollow, unoriginal, and instantly mark your content as uninspired.",
    "Don't rely on dramatic, unsubstantiated future predictions like \"By 2026, traditional chatbots will deliver near-zero ROI\" to create artificial urgency. It screams desperation and lack of genuine insight.",
    "Avoid using generic rhetorical questions as hooks or closers; they rarely engage genuinely and often signal a lack of concrete insight.",
    "Eliminate all \"AI-speak\" buzzwords and phrases like \"human bandwidth,\" \"agentic intelligence\" (unless you immediately define it with *specific, tangible examples*), \"operating system for human ingenuity,\" \"liberates focus for strategic thought,\" and \"human-centric future.\" These are empty calories for the brain. If your grandmother can't understand the core concept without a dictionary, simplify it.",
    "Do not use vague, feel-good adjectives (e.g., \"boldest,\" \"amplified,\" \"strategic,\" \"innovative\") without attaching them to something concrete and demonstrable. Show, don't tell, especially when \"telling\" means using more buzzwords.",
    "Eradicate generic business jargon like \"low-value, repetitive tasks\" or \"higher-impact strategic work.\" Show, don't tell, with specific, impactful scenarios.",
    "Your opening must shock, challenge, or provoke. A dry statistic followed by corporate buzzwords is the fast track to being scrolled past.",
    "Stop asking generic engagement questions at the end. Make a definitive statement, issue a challenge, or offer a unique insight. Don't beg for comments.",
    "Never use phrases like \"Actionable Takeaway.\" It's the hallmark of generic, AI-assisted content that adds no actual value.",
    "Stop using subheadings like \"The Misconception\" or \"The 3-Step Reality.\" You're writing a LinkedIn post, not a white paper outline from 2005. It's painfully predictable.",
    "Don't end your post with a lazy, generic engagement question like \"What specific challenge are you facing...?\" It's a transparent plea for comments, not a genuine attempt to spark conversation.",
    "Never use phrases like 'calculated inaction penalty' or 'strategic trade-off is clear' if you want to sound like a human with original thoughts, not a corporate marketing bot. These are dead giveaways of automated thought leadership.",
    "If your post could be written by an AI after scanning 10,000 corporate white papers, it needs to be scrapped and rewritten by a human.",
    "Stop using generic corporate buzzwords like \"autonomy,\" \"efficiency,\" \"redeployment of talent,\" and \"productivity engine\" without providing *specific, tangible, non-obvious* examples or data that couldn't be found in a press release from 2018.",
    "Hooks must be provocative, counter-intuitive, or intensely specific to cut through the noise. A rhetorical question about an abstract percentage is none of these.",
    "Your \"call to action\" (\"What's the cost of waiting?\") sounds less like a challenge and more like a sad puppy asking for scraps. Give it teeth or make it actionable.",
    "Never use \"significant\" or \"drastically\" to describe an impact; use numbers or stronger, more specific verbs.",
    "Your core thesis should be clear, but avoid over-indexing on a single academic term that might alienate a broader audience if overused. Sometimes a simpler, equally impactful phrase gets the job done without feeling like you're correcting a philosophy paper.",
    "Never dump a dense paragraph of generic adjectives as your \"visual concept.\" If you can't describe your *own* vision in concise, evocative terms, you have no vision.",
    "Don't just define; disrupt. Your post should spark a thought, not just provide a Wikipedia entry. Give us *your* opinion, *your* unique struggle, or *your* audacious prediction, not just the universally agreed-upon facts.",
    "All statistics and failure rates must be cited or clearly qualified as estimates. Don't throw numbers around like confetti if you can't back them up."

  "latest_comment_pack": "### \ud83e\udd1d Comment Pack for LLMs as Operating Systems in Agentic AI\n\n**1. Value Add:**\n\"I completely agree that LLMs acting as operating systems for agentic AI is a game-changer. It's not just about capability, but about efficiency and adaptability. The recent research on models like Falcon-H1R achieving competitive reasoning with just 7B parameters highlights that these orchestrators don't need to be gargantuan to be highly effective, paving the way for more scalable and distributed agentic deployments.\"\n\n**2. Contrarian:**\n\"While the vision of LLMs as operating systems is undeniably exciting, I'd argue that the 'operating system' metaphor might be stretching a bit for what we have currently. Traditional OS excels at deterministic, low-latency resource management and direct hardware interaction \u2013 areas where current LLMs, even agentic ones, still have significant limitations. We might be looking at a powerful application-layer control plane or advanced scheduling, but calling it a true 'operating system' risks understating the fundamental differences in their operational paradigms and the challenges in bridging that gap.\"\n\n**3. Question:**\n\"With the emphasis on 'emerging governance' frameworks and the challenges around ethical deployment and toxicity detection for LLMs as OS, what specific technical and architectural mechanisms do you believe will become standard for enforcing truly robust, dynamic ethical guardrails that can prevent unintended emergent behaviors in complex, autonomous agentic systems at scale?\"",
