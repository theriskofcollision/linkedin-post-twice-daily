    "Avoid vague adjectives like \"dynamic,\" \"intelligent,\" and \"adaptive\" without concrete examples.",
    "Use bolding sparingly and strategically to emphasize critical points.",
    "Minimize the use of italics.",
    "Try replacing \"while\" with \"as\" or splitting the sentence in two.",
    "Never open with \"We stand on the precipice...\" or \"Imagine a future where...\". It's the digital equivalent of a generic stock photo.",
    "Avoid hyperbolic adjectives like \"profound,\" \"perfect,\" \"unheard-of,\" and \"grand\" unless you can back them up with specific, undeniable evidence. Your post is a thesaurus entry for \"aspirational but vague.\"",
    "Stop using fluffy, unspecific metaphors like \"orchestra of AI agents\" or \"digital nervous system\" without immediately following up with concrete, digestible examples. They sound impressive for a second, then fall flat.",
    "If your post sounds like it was written by the same AI it's trying to promote, you've failed. This sounds exactly like ChatGPT's default \"positive, futuristic, slightly buzzwordy\" tone.",
    "Stop using vague, aspirational language that promises everything but delivers nothing specific. \"Reimagining creation itself\" is peak LinkedIn over-promising.",
    "Break up long paragraphs. Use bullet points, short sentences, and bold text to highlight key information.",
    "Never use the word 'unleash'. (And yes, the image text \"Unleash Your Vision\" falls right into this trap. And \"Architect Tomorrow\" is just as bland as the rest of it.)",
    "Never use \"new dawn,\" \"era setting,\" or similar overly dramatic and clich\u00e9 metaphors for technological progress. Be original or be quiet.",
    "Eliminate at least 50% of your adjectives. If it's not adding critical, unique meaning, it's just fluff.",
    "Avoid buzzword bingo like \"collaborative intelligence,\" \"agentic AI\" (without explaining it beyond surface level), \"seamless integration,\" and \"co-create\" if you want to sound like a human and not a marketing bot.",
    "Your call to action (\"Let's discuss, imagine, and build these futures, together. Share your vision below!\") is weak, generic, and overused. Make it specific, actionable, and less like a motivational poster from 2005.",
    "If your post starts with \"X is a term often misunderstood,\" delete it. It's the lazy, unoriginal opener of a thousand forgettable AI-generated explainers. Hook me with a problem, a provocative statement, or a bold prediction \u2013 not a promise to clarify.",
    "Avoid ending your post with a generic, open-ended \"What should I demystify next?\" It's the hallmark of someone who has run out of original thoughts and is desperately fishing for engagement bait. Offer a strong call to action, a bold prediction, or just shut up.",
    "If your post sounds like it was generated by the very AI you're trying to explain, you've failed. Your voice, however flawed, is preferable to polished blandness.",
    "Eliminate redundant summary sentences. The line \"Agentic AI moves beyond assistance to partnership, managing complex workflows. This is key for development.\" adds nothing substantial that hasn't already been covered. Your readers aren't goldfish.",
    "Never start a LinkedIn post with a generic \"We're all...\" or \"It's clear that...\" opener. It's the verbal equivalent of a corporate handshake \u2013 cold and uninspired.",
    "Avoid adjective stuffing. Let powerful nouns and verbs do the heavy lifting, reserving adjectives for truly impactful descriptions.",
    "LinkedIn is not an academic paper. Break up dense paragraphs into digestible chunks, use bullet points, and leverage whitespace.",
    "Eliminate passive voice and corporate jargon that makes your writing sound like an AI trying to sound human. Get direct. Get punchy."

  "latest_comment_pack": "### \ud83e\udd1d Comment Pack for The Rise of Multi-Agent Systems in Agentic AI\n\n**1. Value Add:**\nThis is an incredibly insightful summary of the MAS trend! As we see these multi-agent systems proliferate, especially with enterprise integration, the underlying network infrastructure will become the unsung hero. We're moving beyond simple client-server models to complex inter-agent communication. For instance, achieving the low-latency, high-throughput requirements for real-time collaboration between agents \u2013 particularly those leveraging edge computing for distributed processing \u2013 will heavily depend on advancements in network fabric design and 5G/6G capabilities. The success of large-scale MAS deployments hinges on a network that can guarantee reliable, efficient communication at the speed of thought.\n\n**2. Contrarian:**\nWhile the potential of Multi-Agent Systems is transformative, I'd respectfully add a nuance often overlooked in the excitement: the sheer network complexity and potential for new vulnerabilities they introduce. The brief touches on data privacy and IP, but the \"black box\" nature extends to agent *network behavior*. We're not just securing data at rest, but managing and securing dynamic, bursty, and often unpredictable agent-to-agent communication across heterogeneous networks. Without robust network observability, granular QoS orchestration, and a re-thinking of traditional perimeter security, these systems could become significant bottlenecks or new attack surfaces, undermining their efficiency and introducing unforeseen compliance challenges.\n\n**3. Question:**\nGiven the rise of autonomous multi-agent systems operating across diverse environments and organizational boundaries, and the critical need for high-quality data sharing, what new network security paradigms will be essential to ensure both the integrity and confidentiality of inter-agent communications? Specifically, how do we design network architectures that can prevent compromised agents from propagating threats laterally and guarantee data access compliance when permissions are dynamically negotiated and granted between autonomous entities?",
